# JLyrics 
ðŸŽ¼ Expandable lyrics-scraping API for Java

# Info
Forked from jagrosh/JLyrics as they didnt update the Maven repo and Bintray shutdown.

## Example
```java
LyricsClient client = new LyricsClient();
Lyrics lyrics = client.getLyrics("smooth criminal").get();
System.out.println(lyrics.getContent()); // As he came into the window ...

  * Easily expandable to many lyrics sites
